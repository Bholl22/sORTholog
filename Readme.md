# Presence-Abscence

## Aim

This software will produce a table visualization of the presence and absence of encoded proteins in a given set of genomes. Both, the proteins and set of genomes are required as input by the user.

The primary output will be the table of presence-absence protein data filled using the NCBI Protein Database, as well as PDF and PNG files of the table visualization.
