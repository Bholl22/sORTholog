## Aim

This software will produce a table visualization of the presence and absence of encoded proteins in a given set of genomes. Both, the proteins and set of genomes are required as input by the user.

The primary output will be the table of sORTholog protein data filled using the NCBI Protein Database, as well as PDF and PNG files of the table visualization.

## Installation

### Step 1: install Snakemake and Snakedeploy

Snakemake and Snakedeploy are best installed via the [Mamba package manager](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) (a drop-in replacement for conda). If you have neither Conda nor Mamba, it can be installed via [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). For other options see [here](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba).

To install Mamba by conda, run

```shell
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Given that Mamba is installed, run 

```shell
mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake snakedeploy
```

to install both Snakemake and Snakedeploy in an isolated environment. 

#### Notes 

For all following commands (step 2 to 5) ensure that this environment is activated via 

```shell
conda activate snakemake
```

### Step 2: deploy workflow

 Given that Snakemake and Snakedeploy are installed and available (see Step 1), the workflow can be deployed as follows.

First, create an appropriate project working directory on your system in the place of your choice as follow (note to change the path and file name to the one you want to create): : 

```shell
mkdir path/to/project-workdir
```

Then go to your project working directory as follow:

```shell
cd path/to/project-workdir
```

In all following steps, we will assume that you are inside of that directory.

Second, run 

```shell
snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/vdclab/sORTholog . --tag 0.1.2
```

Snakedeploy will create two folders `workflow` and `config`. The former contains the deployment of the chosen workflow as a [Snakemake module](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#using-and-combining-pre-exising-workflows), the latter contains configuration files which will be modified in the next step in order to configure the workflow to your needs. Later, when executing the workflow, Snakemake will automatically find the main `Snakefile` in the `workflow` subfolder.

### Step 3: configure workflow

#### General settings

To configure this workflow, modify `config/config.yaml` according to your needs, following the explanations provided in the file.  

Seed and taxonomy sheet
- Add seeds to `config/samples.tsv`. For each protein, the columns `seed`, and `protein_id` have to be defined. The protein_id is the protein id define by [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). To include other relevant variables such as color, threshold (e-value, percentage identities and coverage), add a new column to the sheet. Exemple of the `seed file` is present in the `config` folder if needed or in the [doc](https://github.com/vdclab/sORTholog/blob/main/doc/dummy_seeds.tsv) folder in the GitHub page
- Add taxonomic id list to `config/taxid.tsv`. For each genome, the column `TaxId` has to be defined. The TaxId is define by [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). To include other relevant variables such as taxonimical groups (`NCBIGroups`), add a new column to the sheet. The groups that could be used are : `all`, `archaea`, `bacteria`, `fungi`, `invertebrate`, `metagenomes`, `plant`, `protozoa`, `vertebrate_mammalian`, `vertebrate_other` or `viral`.
- You can also configure other parameter such as `project_name`, `output_folder` in the `config/config.yaml` file. Exemple of the `tanonomy file` is present in the `config` folder if needed or in the [doc](https://github.com/vdclab/sORTholog/blob/main/doc/dummy_taxids.tsv) folder in the GitHub page

Missing values can be specified by empty columns or by writing `NA`.

#### Useful options

##### Choose the border shade of the final figure

The shade of the border can be changed using the `colored_border` options in the `config/config.yaml` file:
- if set to `True` the shade of the border is infered from the color set for the seed in the `seed file`
- if set to `False` the color will be black (Default setting)

Here a comparison of the two behaviours:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/colored_border_option.png?raw=true">
</p>

##### Choose the border shape of the final figure

The shape of the border can be changed using the `round_border` option in the `config/config.yaml` file:
- if set to `True` the shape of the border will be round
- if set to `False` the shape of the border will be straight (Default setting)

Here a comparison of the two behaviours:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/round_border_option.png?raw=true">
</p>

### Step 4: run the workflow

Given that the workflow has been properly deployed and configured, it can be executed as follows.

For running the workflow while deploying any necessary software via conda, run Snakemake with 

```shell
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda 
```

If you want to run the workflow with the additional step to speedup the analysis that contains a big dataset you can either:
- Change in the `config.yaml` the parameter `speedup` and change the value to `True`
- Run the workflow adding `-C speedup=True` to the command line as follow

```shell
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda -C speedup=True
```

### Step 5: generate report

After finalizing your data analysis, you can automatically generate an interactive visual HTML report for inspection of results together with parameters and code inside of the browser via 

```shell
snakemake --report report.zip --report-stylesheet config/report.css
```
The resulting report.zip file can be passed on to collaborators, provided as a supplementary file in publications.

### Side notes 

The efficacy of snakemake is dependent upon pre-existing output files, but, without supply of these files by the user, the rule will be triggered.

If you want to re-run a part of the pipeline without running previous rule you can specify the rule you want to run with the option `allowed-rules`

```bash
  --allowed-rules ALLOWED_RULES [ALLOWED_RULES ...]
                        Only consider given rules. If omitted, all rules in Snakefile are used. Note that this is intended primarily for internal use and may lead to unexpected results otherwise. (default: None)
```

For exemple if I want to re-run from silix to all

```bash
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda --allowed-rules silix find_family make_table plots all
```

## Important Notes for running on the cluster

### Step C1: log on the cluster [UFL users]

1) To work on the HiPerGator server, user must first open a terminal (for unix) or command prompt (for windows).  
User must access the server by entering the following command:  
```
ssh (GatorLink ID)@hpg.rc.ufl.edu
```
User will be required to enter their GatorLink account password.
      
2) User will require access to files on the server. To access these files via command line, use the following:  
```
cd /blue/(your group)/(GatorLink ID)
```

For exemple `group` is `lagard` for the VDCLab

You can access to the files of this folder on your computer by adding a server. The address for Windows is as follow: `\\exasmb.rc.ufl.edu`, for Unix (Linux or MacOS) the address: `smb://exasmb.rc.ufl.edu`.  
For more info : https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Samba_Access

### Step C2: load conda

Before starting the installion of the program, you will need to load `conda`; this required software is listed as follows:

```
module load conda
```

After that the step are the same as in `Step 1: install Snakemake and Snakedeploy`, `Step 2: deploy workflow`, `Step 3: configure workflow`.

### Step C3: run the workflow

Given that the workflow has been properly deployed and configured, it can be executed as follows.

For running the workflow while deploying any necessary software via conda and running on the cluster, run Snakemake with 

```shell
snakemake --cores 5 --use-conda --profile config/slurm
```

As previously, if you want to run the workflow with the additional step to speedup the analysis that contains a big dataset you can either:
- Change in the `config.yaml` the parameter `speedup` and change the value to `True`
- Run the workflow adding `-C speedup=True` to the command line as follow

```shell
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda --profile config/slurm -C speedup=True 
```

As previously you can also generate a report following `Step 5: Generate report`.

### Additionnal information

If you want to run it as a job,

1. make sure that the pipeline is deploy where you are and that you change the `config/config.yaml` accordingly to your needs
2. create a file name for exemple `my_project.sh` and copy paste the following

```bash
#!/bin/bash -login
#SBATCH -J sbatch_snakemake 
#SBATCH -t 7-0:00:00
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH --output $PWD/sbatch_snakemake-%j.out
#SBATCH --error $PWD/sbatch-snakemake-%j.err

# activate conda in general
source /home/$(whoami)/.bashrc # if you have the conda init setting

# activate a specific conda environment, if you so choose
conda activate snakemake 

# make things fail on errors
set -o nounset
set -o errexit
set -x

### run your commands here!
snakemake --cores 5 --use-conda --profile config/slurm
snakemake --report report.zip --report-stylesheet config/report.css
```

3. run the following command

```bash
sbatch my_project.sh
```

## Walk-Through and File Production

This pipeline consists of 9/12 steps called rules that take input files and create output files. Here is a description of the pipeline.

1. As snakemake is set up, there is a last rule, called `all`, that serves to call the last output files and make sure they were created.

2. A folder containing your work will be created:

```
   [project_name]/                           <- top-level project folder (your project_name)
   â”‚
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â”€ report.html                           <- This report file

   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€ taxid_checked.txt              <- Fasta with the concatenation of the genome of interest and seeds
   â”‚   â”‚
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ seeds                             
   â”‚       â”œâ”€ seeds.fasta                    <- Fasta file of the seeds
   â”‚       â””â”€ new_seeds.tsv                  <- Table with the informations about the seeds
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_thresholds                   <- (Optional) Generate by the rule report_thresholds
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tables                         
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€ table--seed.tsv                <- (Optional) Table with the information of each pair of hits in for the seed family (one per seed)
   â”‚   â”‚
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ report_figure_thresholds.html     <- (Optional) HTML report with the plots made by report_thresholds                  
   â”‚
   â””â”€â”€ results                               <- Final results for sharing with collaborators, typically derived from analysis sets
       â”œâ”€â”€ fasta                             <- (Optional) folder with the fasta file of the orthologs of the seeds
       â”œâ”€â”€ patab_melt.tsv                    <- Table with the information of sORTholog one information by line
       â”œâ”€â”€ patab_table.tsv                   <- Table with the information of presence absence with genome in index and seeds in columns and proteins Id in the cell
       â””â”€â”€ plots                             <- Plots and table on which the plot are created

```

3. Before starting the pipeline, your taxids will be checked and updated for the lowest descendant levels. This will create a file of checked taxids. It will skip this step if this file already exists.

4. When restarting the pipeline, the software will check if you made any changes in the seed file before running. If changes have been made, it will run what is necessary, else nothing will happen.
